I'm pursuing a BS in Computer Science with a minor in Electrical Engineering and Neuroscience at Texas A&M University. 

My interests lie at the intersection of tech and philosphy. Specifically, I'm passionate about neurotech and aspire to use computers to make healthcare more affordable and accessible.
