I'm pursuing a B.S. in Computer Science with a minor in Electrical Engineering and Neuroscience at Texas A&M University. 

My interests lie in deep learning, computer vision, and the intersection of AI and philosphy. Specifically, I'm passionate about neurotech and aspire to use my interest in computers to make healthcare more affordable and accessible.
